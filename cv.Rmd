I obtained my BS degree in Physics in 2004 from the Universidad del Valle, Cali-Colombia. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physical sciences in a collaboration with Universidad del Valle and UC San Diego in 2009.

My PhD thesis was in the area of Complex oxides. More specifically in the metal-insulator transition in VO~2~ at the nano-scale.
