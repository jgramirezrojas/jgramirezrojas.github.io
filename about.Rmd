  Now I have studied philosophy,
  medicine and the law,
  and unfortunately, theology,
  wearily sweating, yet I stand now,
  poor fool, no wiser than I was before;
  I am called Master, even Doctor,
  and for these last ten years have led
  my students by the nose--up, down,
  crosswise and crooked. Now I see
  that we know nothing finally.” Faust. Goethe



I am a condensed matter physicist. My research is experiment-focused and is mostly related to the search of novel magnetic properties in complex oxides via proximity effects. I study their magnetism dynamics and transport properties. Currently, I am associate professor of physics at [Universidad de los Andes](https//www.uniandes.edu.co), Bogotá, Colombia. Here is the link [to the nano-magnetism (Nanoscience and Quantum phenomena)](https://nanomag.uniandes.edu.co).

My current interest are listed below. More information about our research at the Nanomag site.

## Tuning Multifunctional Properties of Complex Oxides

My current research focuses on exploring the multifunctional properties of complex oxides by tuning their nano-structure in the form of nanoparticles. By varying the size of these nanoparticles, we can control the strength of the interactions present in these materials, allowing us to access interactions with different length scales. Our recent work, published in Scientific Reports (Carranza-Celis et al., 2019), highlights our progress in this area.

## Novel Approaches to Multifunctional Properties

Our research group is dedicated to developing novel approaches to utilizing the multifunctional properties of oxide materials. We are particularly interested in Resistive Switching, a key technology in Neuromorphic Computing, and Oxide systems based on Transition Metal elements. By studying materials with multifunctional properties, we hope to identify promising candidates for future implementations of neuromorphic architectures. Our work on this topic has been published in the Journal of Applied Physics (del Valle et al., 2018).

## Proximity Effects in Complex Oxides

My proposed research focuses on studying the proximity effects in complex oxides at the nano-scale. These oxides exhibit highly unique properties, including collective phenomena such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, enhanced photoconductivity, and electron transfer. Oxides also play a crucial role in both energy and information technologies, such as batteries, solar cells, catalysis, and various electronic and magnetic devices. By studying proximity effects in complex oxides, we hope to uncover new insights into their properties and applications.
