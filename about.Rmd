  Now I have studied philosophy,
  medicine and the law,
  and unfortunately, theology,
  wearily sweating, yet I stand now,
  poor fool, no wiser than I was before;
  I am called Master, even Doctor,
  and for these last ten years have led
  my students by the nose--up, down,
  crosswise and crooked. Now I see
  that we know nothing finally.” Faust. Goethe



I am a condensed matter physicist. My research is experiment-focused and is mostly related to the search of novel magnetic properties in complex oxides via proximity effects. I study their magnetism dynamics and transport properties. Currently, I am associate professor of physics at [Universidad de los Andes](https//www.uniandes.edu.co), Bogotá, Colombia. Here is the link [to the nano-magnetism (Nanoscience and Quantum phenomena)](https://nanomag.uniandes.edu.co).

My current interest are listed below. More information about our research at the Nanomag site.

#### Complex oxides 

At the moment, I am interested in tuning multifunctional properties of complex oxides via nano-structuration in the form of nanoparticles. Many interactions present in these materials have a length scale that can be accessed by varying the nanoparticle size, therefore, allowing for a control of the strength of their interactions. More info in Carranza-Celis et. al.,   Scientific Reports 9, 3182 (2019) .

#### Multifuncttional properties

We are interested in novel approaches (devices and properties) that use the multifunctional properties of oxide materials. For instance, Resistive Switching is at the core of implementations of Neuromorphic computing and Oxide systems based on Transition Metal elements. We are studying materials with multifunctional properties as candidates for future implementations of neuromorphic architectures.   J. del Valle et. al.,  J. Appl. Phys. 124, 211101 (2018)

#### Proximity effects

I propose to study proximity effects in complex oxides at the nano-scale. Oxides exhibit highly unique properties including collective phenomena such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, enhanced photoconductivity and electron transfer. Oxides also play a key role in both energy and information technologies. Examples include batteries, solar cells, catalysis, and miscellaneous electronic and magnetic devices.
